This library was adapted from SSD1351_t3 by Paul Stoffregen which itself was adapted from the Adafruit 1.8" SPI display library:
  This library works with the Adafruit 1.8" TFT Breakout w/SD card
  ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/358
  as well as Adafruit raw 1.8" TFT display
  ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/618

  Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams
  These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required to
  interface (RST is optional)
  Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
  please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
  products from Adafruit!
